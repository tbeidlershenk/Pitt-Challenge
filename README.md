## Pill Identifier

### Project Motivation
Age related visual impairment is major health problem among the elderly. With advancing age, the normal function of eye tissues decreases and there is an increased incidence of some form of visual impairment. The most common causes of age related visual impairment in the elderly are cataracts, which affect 1 in 5 adults over the age of 65, and presbyopia which affects over 85 percent of adults over 40. With statistics like this, it seems almost inevitable that someone could take the mistakenly take the wrong pill. For Senior Citizens, taking the wrong pill could be life-threatening. Our project aims to eliminate that concern for every senior citizen. With our Pill Identifier, anyone can get the name and information about the pills they take by simply taking a picture of it.
