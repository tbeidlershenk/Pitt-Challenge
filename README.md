## Pill Identifier

### Project Motivation
Age related visual impairment is a major health problem among the elderly. With advancing age, the normal function of eye tissues decreases and there is an increased incidence of some form of visual impairment. The most common causes of age related visual impairment in the elderly are cataracts, which affect 1 in 5 adults over the age of 65, and presbyopia which affects over 85 percent of adults over 40. With statistics like this, it seems almost inevitable that someone could take the mistakenly take the wrong pill. For Senior Citizens, taking the wrong pill could be life-threatening. Our project aims to eliminate that concern for every senior citizen. With our Pill Identifier, anyone can get the name and information about the pills they take by simply taking a picture of it. 

### Project Description
The Pill Identifier will essentially determine the kind of pill that the user takes a picture of with their smart phone camera. The results are back by our machine learning algorithm that compares the input image to a large dataset of picture of various kinds of pills. This is a web-based application that takes in the users image as an input, and then returns to them the most likely identification of the pill that they submitted. Additionally, the result will have information about the pill that was phtotgraphed including uses, side effects, as well as possible risks. We want to limit any accidents and make sure that they are getting staying safe. 

On the front end, we used html, css, and javascript to make a easy to understand user-interface since our target demographic would be less familiar with technology. We made the decision to use large font's and high-contrast colors to make sure that our visually impaired users can effortlessly learn which pill they are about to take.
